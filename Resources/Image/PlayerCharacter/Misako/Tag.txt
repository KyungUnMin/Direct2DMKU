Notes: Animations with repeated frames are mentioned as such in their filenames.
       Underscores imply separate frame numbers, whereas dashes signify frame ranges.
       "RCG1" prefixes are only in the first River City Girls, "RCG2" are only in River City Girls 2.
       Misako sure has a lot of unused sprites / older revisions compared to everyone else.
